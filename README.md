## Install the package
All required Python dependencies are included in this project configuration and can be installed with a single command:
`pip install -e .`

## External Libraries
The preprocessing stage of this project depends on three external algorithms.
Executable files and their required dependencies are already included in this repository, so manual installation is typically not necessary.

However, if you encounter version conflicts or environment-related issues during preprocessing, please refer to the official repositories of the following three libraries:
- [DevelopApp][developapp] — piecewise developable approximation.
